This is a Data Science Project called "School Funding Effects". I created this project for a data science course I took over the summer of 2025
and it is about why federal and state funding are crucial to school deistricts in Washijngton State. This project also uses python programming to
clean datasets for producing reliable data and creates visual graphs to show various trends in critical relationships. These visuals include bar
graphs and scatterplots, and how they relate school  district programs enrollment and test scores to poverty rates and per - stuident fundings. 
Finally, hypothesis testing is also used to evaluate the reliability in sources, public datasets, and data relationships.
