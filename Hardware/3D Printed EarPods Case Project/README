This is a product engineering project I created with CAD using Fusion 360 called "3D Printed EarPods Case". I created this during my Engineering Design class in February 2025 individually
and the file contains the WORD document for my project rationale and presentation with an overall design statement, concept sketches, solution path, anotated concept sketch with tolerances, 
working drawings in multiview, photo of 3D printed model, and reflection of the concept statement. In addition, my CAD file from Fusion 360 is also present in this file.
